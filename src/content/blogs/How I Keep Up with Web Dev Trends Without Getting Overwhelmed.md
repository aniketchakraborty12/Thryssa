Be real with yourself for a moment — can you imagine the internet without trends? Can you see any big companies attracting customers, or influencers racking up views without engaging in clickbait?

**Precisely.**

The internet runs on trends. If it's trendy, it's worth checking out. The more hype there is about the trend, the more interaction there is, which leads to even more hype. This is true even for the programming field that works with the internet, web development.

Trust me, I've collided with the *JavaScript framework* hype train more times than I'd like to admit. Initially, when I started with plain HTML, CSS & JS, there was a massive uproar amongst the web community. The long-running battle between React and Angular had sprung up again, and I was mesmerised enough to be drawn in and given the choice. Of course, I chose React.

~~Not~~ enjoying learning React for a little over 6 months, I was dragged into *yet another* decision — jumping on the Next.js bandwagon. Now, back then, Next.js v15 was gearing up for its release, and everyone was gassed. Sure enough, with my limited knowledge of hooks and client-side rendering, I was there to devour the meal.

Then came Astro.js, and it promised speed and simplicity. By this time, you should know how the story works. I jumped ship again to learn Astro.js and created this very blog website with it.

Hence, after burying multiple neglected frameworks, I am here to tell you how I started keeping up with web development trends without getting overwhelmed.

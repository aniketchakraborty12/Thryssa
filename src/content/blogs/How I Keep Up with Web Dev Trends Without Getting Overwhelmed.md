Be real with yourself for a moment — can you imagine the internet without trends? Can you see any big companies attracting customers, or influencers racking up views without engaging in clickbait?

**Precisely.**

The internet runs on trends. If it's trendy, it's worth checking out. The more hype there is about the trend, the more interaction there is, which leads to even more hype. This is true even for the programming field that works with the internet, web development.

Trust me, I've collided with the *JavaScript framework* hype train more times than I'd like to admit. Initially, when I started with plain HTML, CSS & JS, there was a massive uproar amongst the web community. The long-running battle between React and Angular had sprung up again, and I was mesmerised enough to be drawn in and given the choice. Of course, I chose React.

~~Not~~ enjoying learning React for a little over 6 months, I was dragged into *yet another* decision — jumping on the Next.js bandwagon. Now, back then, Next.js v15 was gearing up for its release, and everyone was gassed. Sure enough, with my limited knowledge of hooks and client-side rendering, I was there to devour the meal.

Then came Astro.js, and it promised speed and simplicity. By this time, you should know how the story works. I jumped ship again to learn Astro.js and created this very blog website with it.

Hence, after burying multiple neglected frameworks, I am here to tell you how I started keeping up with web development trends without getting overwhelmed.

## Does It Matter? Yes? Then Let's Do It.

First of all, look at the problem you're aiming to solve, and whether your current repertoire is good enough to cover it. For example, if you're aiming to create a static portfolio website that is fast and has an easier learning curve, then Next.js won't cut it. You'll be better off learning Astro.js than Next.js, as it primarily focuses on speed and does not contain overwhelming amounts of JavaScript.

Below are some of the important factors you need to check before choosing:

### Identify your niche

Are you a frontend developer? Are you a backend developer? Are you a full-stack developer? Are you an Android developer?

If you don't ask yourself these questions often, you'll undoubtedly miss out on your preferences. You have to constantly remind yourself of your domain and interest, and align the learning curve to cover all, but only that part. Learn everything in that, but learn only that. No less, no more.

You don't need to go around learning Node.js if you're primarily focusing on covering frontend, nor do you need to learn Vue or Svelte to become an Android developer. Search the internet for the frameworks that align with your interests, and invest yourself in learning them.

### Striker! Go For Goals!

For this subtopic, I'll be taking help from appropriate examples. So, let's get on with it.

Firstly, you're asked to create a static portfolio. What are the prerequisites? Blazingly fast, no need for flashy animations that render slowly, and easy to navigate. If I were you, I'd lean towards Astro.js for this task.

Secondly, you're asked to create a single-page application for an NGO. It does not have to be fast, but it'll have a lot of routing and reusable components to deal with. You'd better get used to working with Vue.js for these scenarios.

Lastly, you're asked to create an admin dashboard for a company. It must have charts, heavy components, a connected database, and a bit of animation. You're gearing up to utilise Next.js for this one.

### You're No AI

Tools like ChatGPT, BlackBox, and Gemini are known to be capable AI tools used to generate content within seconds. Although the content may seem monotonous, users can repeatedly generate it without delay. This is because they are tools, just like any non-living thing.

The human body, on the other hand, isn't designed to be relentless. It requires rest and maintenance to function optimally for an extended period.

If you start feeling tired and/or overwhelmed, stop and take some rest. Don't overburden your body with rigorous practices — it deteriorates the body's capability and might be the leading cause for any health complexities.

## Consistency over Quantity

Continuing the previous subtopic, it is important to realise that consistency is prized far more than the amount of hours put into the work. You can put 6 hours of lethargic effort behind a task and finish 70%, or you can put 3.5 hours of complete unwavering attention and effort behind the same task and complete it.

The value lies in the amount of effort and attention invested, not the time.

### One New Thing A Week

The best way to go about it is to follow the "one new thing a week" policy. It aims to break down the load among the days of the week, effectively increasing productivity and practising scheduling.

Suppose you need to learn hooks in React. You aim to distribute the entire list of hooks between the days of the week. In this way, you get more time to invest in each hook, your schedule is pre-planned, and your productivity gets a considerable boost.

### Blocks for Time, not CSS

Now that your schedule is up and ready, it is important to break the individual days so that you don't burn out too soon. The best way of doing that is by assigning blocks of time with occasional free time squeezed in between.

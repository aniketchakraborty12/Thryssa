Be real with yourself for a moment — can you imagine the internet without trends? Can you see any big companies attracting customers, or influencers racking up views without engaging in clickbait?

**Precisely.**

The internet runs on trends. If it's trendy, it's worth checking out. The more hype there is about the trend, the more interaction there is, which leads to even more hype. This is true even for the programming field that works with the internet, web development.

Trust me, I've collided with the *JavaScript framework* hype train more times than I'd like to admit. Initially, when I started with plain HTML, CSS & JS, there was a massive uproar amongst the web community. The long-running battle between React and Angular had sprung up again, and I was mesmerised enough to be drawn in and given the choice. Of course, I chose React.

~~Not~~ enjoying learning React for a little over 6 months, I was dragged into *yet another* decision — jumping on the Next.js bandwagon. Now, back then, Next.js v15 was gearing up for its release, and everyone was gassed. Sure enough, with my limited knowledge of hooks and client-side rendering, I was there to devour the meal.

Then came Astro.js, and it promised speed and simplicity. By this time, you should know how the story works. I jumped ship again to learn Astro.js and created this very blog website with it.

Hence, after burying multiple neglected frameworks, I am here to tell you how I started keeping up with web development trends without getting overwhelmed.

## Does It Matter? Yes? Then Let's Do It.

First of all, look at the problem you're aiming to solve, and whether your current repertoire is good enough to cover it. For example, if you're aiming to create a static portfolio website that is fast and has an easier learning curve, then Next.js won't cut it. You'll be better off learning Astro.js than Next.js, as it primarily focuses on speed and does not contain overwhelming amounts of JavaScript.

Below are some of the important factors you need to check before choosing:

### Identify your niche

Are you a frontend developer? Are you a backend developer? Are you a full-stack developer? Are you an Android developer?

If you don't ask yourself these questions often, you'll undoubtedly miss out on your preferences. You have to constantly remind yourself of your domain and interest, and align the learning curve to cover all, but only that part. Learn everything in that, but learn only that. No less, no more.

You don't need to go around learning Node.js if you're primarily focusing on covering frontend, nor do you need to learn Vue or Svelte to become an Android developer. Search the internet for the frameworks that align with your interests, and invest yourself in learning them.

### Striker! Go For Goals!

For this subtopic, I'll be taking help from appropriate examples. So, let's get on with it.

Firstly, you're asked to create a static portfolio. What are the prerequisites? Blazingly fast, no need for flashy animations that render slowly, and easy to navigate. If I were you, I'd lean towards Astro.js for this task.

Secondly, you're asked to create a single-page application for an NGO. It does not have to be fast, but it'll have a lot of routing and reusable components to deal with. You'd better get used to working with Vue.js for these scenarios.

Lastly, you're asked to create an admin dashboard for a company. It must have charts, heavy components, a connected database, and a bit of animation. You're gearing up to utilise Next.js for this one.

See how I changed the tech stack according to the requirements? Learn how to circle out your goals, and you'll pave your path towards the perfect framework in no time.

### You're No AI

Tools like ChatGPT, BlackBox, and Gemini are known to be capable AI tools used to generate content within seconds. Although the content may seem monotonous, users can repeatedly generate it without delay. This is because they are tools, just like any non-living thing.

The human body, on the other hand, isn't designed to be relentless. It requires rest and maintenance to function optimally for an extended period.

If you start feeling tired and/or overwhelmed, stop and take some rest. Don't overburden your body with rigorous practices — it deteriorates the body's capability and might be the leading cause for any health complexities.

## Consistency over Quantity

Continuing the previous subtopic, it is important to realise that consistency is prized far more than the amount of hours put into the work. You can put 6 hours of lethargic effort behind a task and finish 70%, or you can put 3.5 hours of complete unwavering attention and effort behind the same task and complete it.

The value lies in the amount of effort and attention invested, not the time.

### One New Thing A Week

The best way to go about it is to follow the "one new thing a week" policy. It aims to break down the load among the days of the week, effectively increasing productivity and practising scheduling.

Suppose you need to learn hooks in React. You aim to distribute the entire list of hooks between the days of the week. In this way, you get more time to invest in each hook, your schedule is pre-planned, and your productivity gets a considerable boost.

### Blocks for Time, not CSS

Now that your schedule is up and ready, it is important to break the individual days so that you don't burn out too soon. The best way to do this is by assigning focused time blocks throughout the day, with occasional breaks in between to recharge.

Since we're talking about hooks in React, say you aim to finish the useState hook in 1 day. Fair enough goal, but how many examples are you aiming to practice in 1 go? Should it be 3? 4? 5?

The answer is — the number you can fit within the space of an hour. No need to push yourself to finish as much as you can in that 1 hour, but understand each concept and example before moving on to the next. In that way, you'll learn both the concept and the art of preserving stamina and attention. A 15-minute break later, you're back again in front of your device, aiming to complete the next example.

### It's Hands-On Time

Till this point, all you did was plan. You planned how to divide your work into a week. You planned how to take rests between your tasks in a day. Realistically, the next course of action is getting your hands dirty and actually implementing them. What better way to see if the calibrations work as intended than actually to work with them?

Well, it goes deeper than just that. You see, different projects require different attention spans. You can't possibly expect to learn hooks the same way you learned routing in React. Every concept is different, and the method to learn and practice them differs. What you're actually doing is fine-tuning the practice sessions according to your needs.

The 1-hour mark for each session will undoubtedly be stretched, and that's fair, as long as you don't forget to take that break. Practice the methods, and see what works for you. Is it 1-week or less? Is it 1-hour or more? Who knows, except you yourself?

## It's a Sign, to Tune Out

What happens if you forget to take that break? Does your body feel nauseous? Heavy? Do you become tired easily? Cannot continue with the same intensity?

These are the signs that your body gives you to tell you to stop. It is a simple sign — "You are overburdening the body with the tasks. Please take a break".

### It's Giving — Trend Fatigue

As said earlier, your body isn't a machine. It is not meant for continuous hours of rigorous and uninterrupted work. The more you deprive your body of its necessary cooldown period, the more it'll start to act up. Nausea, tiredness, and unwillingness to work are some of the most common but vital signs of what I decided to term 'Trend Fatigue'.

You're (un)intentionally making a habit or trend out of depleting your body's strength, sapping out its energy and not replenishing it properly. As a result, your body cannot give its 100% every time, and the depletion occurs every session. Soon, your body might break down, and you might face a serious illness that'll hinder your ability to take part in trends.

Therefore, make sure to get your hourly dose of refreshments to keep in touch with the modern trends. After all, it's highly unlikely that several groundbreaking frameworks will be released during your 15-minute break.

### Chill Out, It's You

Finally, **stop competing with people** when it comes to keeping up with trends. The very obvious reason is that everybody's intake capability is different. One might catch up to trends within a week after their release, while the other might take 2 weeks. It does not mean that the latter is slow or ineffective. You're doing what needs to be done, and you're doing it at your own pace. Stop comparing your progress with everybody else.

> Comparison is the thief of joy

Learn to be hungry, but content. You're competing with yourself, you're learning for yourself. Don't let an outsider disrupt your focus and divert your attention.

While keeping up with trends might be a good idea, the best idea is to keep in touch with your sanity and body during the entire ordeal. You'll need much more than just a good internet connection to be able to keep up; you'll need your brain and body to function at 100% of their capacity.

 That's all there is to it. Please feel free to comment on your views on this article below. I'll be back next time with another educational blog.

 **Until next time!**
